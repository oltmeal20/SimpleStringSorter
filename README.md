# SimpleStringSorter
This code uses the command line to sort strings in alphabetical order

How it works is that it reads each command line input as a char, and it reads
the length of the input. it takes these variables and one at a time, it uses
strcmp to compare two characters at a time to determine which input is larger 
(ASCII is used to determine the size of the first letter of each character). 
The smaller input is stored in an array and it moves onto the next input
until every input is accounted for. The array is then printed once the array is 
alphabetically sorted.

It works on both replit and Visual Studios 2019
